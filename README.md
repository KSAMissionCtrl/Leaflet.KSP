Leaflet.KSP
==========

Leaflet.KSP is a [Lealfet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin for displaying [celestial bodies](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Celestials) from [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/).

The plugin powers the community based [Kerbal Maps](http://www.kerbalmaps.com) website.

Usage
-----

Incorporating Leaflet.KSP into your own site or web based mod is easy:

```js
map = new L.KSP.Map('yourDivId',  {
 // define options
	layers: [ L.KSP.CelestialBody.KERBIN ], // default: kerbin
	zoom: L.KSP.CelestialBody.KERBIN.defaultLayer.options.maxZoom
	center: [ -0.1027, -74.5754 ], // Kerbal Space Center
	bodyControl: true, // show body control. default: false
	layerControl: true, // show layer control. default: false
	scaleControl: true // show scale control. default: false
});
```

Building Leaflet.KSP from Source
--------------------------------

Leaflet build system is powered by the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) platform and Jake, JSHint and UglifyJS libraries, which install easily and work well across all major platforms. Here are the steps to install it:

1. [Download and install Node](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Run the following commands in the command line:

	```text
	npm install -g jake
	npm install jshint
	npm install uglify-js
    ```
3. Now that you have everything installed, run ```jake``` inside the Leaflet.KSP directory. This will check Leaflet source files for JavaScript errors and inconsistencies, and then combine and minify it to the dist folder.
